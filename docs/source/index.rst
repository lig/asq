Welcome to ``asq``
==================

``asq`` is a Python package for specifying and performing efficient queries
over collections of Python objects using a fluent interface. Asq can work with
Python *iterables* of any type.  The query interface is inspired by Microsoft's
LINQ API although adjustments have been made to make the interface more
Pythonic, and all queries are represented using standard Python syntax with no
support for in-language query syntax.
