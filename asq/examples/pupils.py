# It is very common to have selectors which retrieve a particular attribute
# from an object or index into the object using a particular key.  In these
# cases Python's lambda syntax can seem quite clunky.  To mitigate this, asq
# provides two factory functions called a_() and k_() which concisely generate
# selector functions for attributes and keys respectively.  The previous
# example could thus be rendered as::

query(students).order_by(k_('lastname')).then_by(k_('firstname'))
