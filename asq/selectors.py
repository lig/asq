'''Create a selector function which indexes into the element by key.

The callable object returned by this function fetches one or more items from
its only operand using the operand's __getitem__() method. If multiple items
are specified a tuple of looked-up values will be returned.

Args:
    key: The key which the generated selector will use to index into
        elements.

    *args: Optional additional arguments which will be used as additional keys
        for lookup.  If supplied then the created selector will return a tuple
        of values.

Returns:
    A unary selector function which indexes into its only argument with
    the supplied key value(s).

a_ = operator.attrgetter
'''Create a selector function which selects an attribute by name.

The callable object returned by this function fetches one or more
attributes from its only operand using the operand's __getitem__() method.
If multiple items are specified a tuple of retrieved attribute values will
be returned.

Args:
    name: The name of the attribute which will be retrieved from each
        element. The attribute name may contain dots which will be resolved
        through sequential attribute lookups.

    *args: Optional additional attribute names which will be used as
    additional attribute names for lookup.  If supplied then the created
    selector will return a tuple of values. The attribute name may contain
    dots which will be resolved through sequential attribute lookups.

Returns:
    A unary selector function which retrieves the named attribute(s) from
    its only argument and returns the value(s) of those attribute(s).
'''


m_ = operator.methodcaller
'''Create a selector function which calls a named method.

Args:
    name: The name of the method which will be called on each element.

    *args: Any optional positional arguments which will be passed to the
        called method.

    **kwargs: Any optional named arguments which will be passed to the
        called method.

Returns:
    A unary selector function which calls the named method with any
    optional positional or named arguments and which returns the
    result of the method call.
